# Take two numbers from the users. Calculate the result of second number power of the first number.

var1 = float(input("Insert your first number: "))
var2 = float(input("Insert your second number: "))

#print(f"{var2} to the power of {var1} is equal to: ", var2**var1)


## or using pow

print(f"{var2} to the power of {var1} is equal to: ", pow(var2,var1))
